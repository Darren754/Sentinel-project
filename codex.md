# Codex instructions for this repo

- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Do not remove working functionality.
- If unsure about hardware-specific code paths, ask before changing.
- Keep `sentinel.py` runnable as the main entry point.
- When adding features, add small helper modules rather than growing one file forever.
